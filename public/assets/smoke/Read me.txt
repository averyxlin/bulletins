📌 HOW TO USE
-------------------------------------------

You can import the sprite sheets into your engine or editor and use slicing tools to break them into frames.  
Or use the PNG sequences if your engine supports frame-by-frame animations (e.g. Unity, Godot, GameMaker).

All animations are designed at 64x64 resolution. You can upscale them as needed.
